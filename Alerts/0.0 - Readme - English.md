# SQL Server Alerts

Hi Guys!

In this repository, I would like to share with you a project that i'm deleloping for years and using with our clientes.

This is a big project to share scripts to monitor SQL Server if you don't have a tool to do that.

In 2017 I release the version 1.0:
https://www.fabriciolima.net/blog/2017/05/01/criando-um-e-mail-de-checklist-diario-no-sql-server/
https://www.fabriciolima.net/blog/2017/10/05/video-criando-15-alertas-no-sql-server-em-apenas-5-minutos/

Now, in September-2019, I reseased the version 2.0:
  - I will still do a blog post explaining how to use this script in English. (Pending)
  - For now I just did a portuguese video explaining how to create the alerts.
